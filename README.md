# DummyDev

This tool is designed to mimic developer workflow for a project. It is designed to be used to simulate the load on a network / file system when a number of students are working on projects. 

The base system is developed in python and works by reading a simple manifest file written in json. Each file is an incremental process that writes set data to files, then runs the build process. 

Initial setup will create folders and empty files etc.
